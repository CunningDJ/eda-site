# EDA App - Server & Message Consumer
**For quickstart instructions, look at the [top level README](/README.md#getting-started)**

## Setup
1. Run `./start.sh` in the [kafka-dev-scripts/](/kafka-dev-scripts) directory to set up the Kafka server
2. In this directory, run `npm install`
  
## Running
`npm run build` will transpile the Typescript, and `npm start` will run the JS that's transpiled.  However, to make this easier, you can also just `npm run build:start` when you want to build and run changes in one go.
